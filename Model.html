<p class="p1">The Relational Model was introduced in 1970 by E.F.Codd.The relational models foundation is a mathematical
 concept known as a relation.Each relation <b>(table)</b> is represented as a two-dimensional structure composed
 of intersecting rows and columns.Each row in a relation is called a <b>tuple</b>. Each column represents a 
<b>attribute</b>. The relaions are related to each other through the sharing of common entity charactertics.
The relational model also describes a precise set of data manipulation constructs based on advanced mathematical
concepts. He work was considered ingenious but impractical.<br><br>
   The relational model's conceptual simplicity was bought at the expence of computer overhead; computers at that
time lacked the power to implement the relational model. Fortunately, computer power grew exponentially, as did operating
system efficiency. Better yet, the cost of computers diminished rapidly as their power grew. The relational data model
is implemented through a very sophisticated <b>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</b>. The RDBMS performs the same
basic functions provided by the hierarchical and network DBMS systems, in addition to a host of other functions that make
the relational data model easier to understand and implement. The most important advantage of the RDBMS is its ability to
hide the complexities of relational model from the user. the RDBMS manages all of the physical details, while the user
sees the relational database as a collection of tabkes in which data is stored. the user can manipulate and the data
in a way that seems intaitive and logical.The relational model provides a minimum level of controlled redundancy
to eliminate most of the redundancies commonly found in file systems.</p>
<h1 align="center"><u>Types of Relations</u></h1>
<h2>1. ONE-TO-ONE:</h2>

<p class="p1">A one-to-one relationship means that for every record in one table (or entity), there's only one
corresponding record in another table, and the reverse is also true. The above diagram shows that it’s
mandatory for a capital to have a country and it’s mandatory for a country to have a capital.One-to-one 
relationships are the least frequent relationship type. One of the reasons for this is that very few 
one-to-one relationships exist in real life. Also, most one-to-one relationships are one-to-one only for some
period of time.</p><br>  
<h2>2. ONE-TO-MANY:</h2>

</td></table>
<p class="p1">A one-to-many relationship is a fundamental concept in relational database design, where a single
instance of one entity (or table) is linked to zero, one, or many instances of another entity. <b>Example:</b>
Consider a "Customers" table and an "Orders" table. Each customer can place many orders, but each order belongs
to only one customer. This is a one-to-many relationship where "Customers" is the "one" side and "Orders" is 
the "many" side.  One-to-many often refer to a primary key to foreign key relationship between two tables, 
where the record in the first table can relate to multiple records in the second table. A foreign key is one 
side of the relationship that shows a row or multiple rows, with one of those rows being the primary key 
already listed on the first table.</p><br>
<h2>3. MANY-TO-MANY:</h2>
<table align="center" border="2px" border-color="black"><td>

             height="250px" width="400px"><br>
</td></table>
<p class="p1">A many-to-many relationship occurs when each instance of one entity can be associated with 
multiple instances of another entity, and vice versa. <b>Example:</b>Consider a database for a school: a 
student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students enrolled. This creates a many-to-many 
relationship between the "Students" and "Courses" tables.
<b>How it works:</b>
You would have a "Students" table with student information, a "Courses" table with course information, and a 
"StudentCourses" (or similar) join table. 
The "StudentCourses" table would contain columns for "StudentID" (foreign key referencing the "Students" table)
and "CourseID" (foreign key referencing the "Courses" table). 
Each row in the "StudentCourses" table would represent a student enrolled in a particular course.</p><br>
